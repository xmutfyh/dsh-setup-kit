# DSH Writing Guard

[![Awesome DSH Plugin](https://awesome-dsh-plugin.com/badge.svg)](https://awesome-dsh-plugin.com)
[![CI](https://github.com/xmutfyh/dsh-plugin-writing-guard/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/xmutfyh/dsh-plugin-writing-guard/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

> DeepSeek Harness (DSH) academic-writing guard: automatically checks papers for common AI writing
> style, revision-process residue, defensive writing, and mechanical sentence patterns — while you write,
> and protects research facts during polishing (v0.6 Scholarship Lock).

**Works with: Chinese papers, English papers, SCI manuscripts, theses, academic writing and polishing.**

The plugin is not a one-shot "humanizer" that rewrites your whole paper after it is done.
Instead it works continuously:

**rules before writing → guard while writing → audit after edits.**

It provides three native DSH tools:

- `writing_rules` — load the writing-discipline cheat sheet before writing
- `writing_audit` — scan text for AI-style patterns, revision residue, defensive writing, LLM-overused expressions and structural tells; v0.6 adds Scholarship Lock (`original` arg) and author style profile (`styleProfile` arg)
- `writing_style_profile` — learn an author's writing style from previous papers (sentence-length distribution, densities), zero LLM

and optionally auto-audits paper files (`.md` / `.tex` / `.txt`) after every `write` / `edit`
(v0.5 incremental mode), feeding only *new* high-risk issues back to the agent.

> Positioning: not an "AI detector", but a writing linter that knows what kind of document it is
> looking at and can explain *why* it flags something.
> All rules are local regex/statistics — zero network, zero LLM calls, millisecond latency.

## Why Writing Guard instead of a Humanizer?

| | Writing Guard | Humanizer | AI Detector |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rules before writing | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Checks while writing | ✅ | usually ❌ | ❌ |
| Auto-audits paper edits | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Full-text rewrite | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Explainable issue location | ✅ | partial | partial |
| Revision residue detection | ✅ | not necessarily | ❌ |
| Defensive writing detection | ✅ | not necessarily | ❌ |
| Local rules (zero network / zero LLM) | ✅ | usually needs LLM | varies |

> Writing Guard is complementary to Humanizers, not a replacement.
> Humanizer workflow: AI draft → rewrite → humanized version.
> Writing Guard workflow: rules → writing → automatic audit → targeted revision.
>
> **A humanizer fixes the text after it's written; Writing Guard guards it as you write.**

## About "removing AI flavor"

In this project, "removing AI flavor" means identifying and reducing mechanical, templated,
over-structured LLM writing style — the goal is better academic expression, not guaranteed
evasion of any AI-detection system.

## Document-profile awareness (v0.3)

The same sentence means different things in different documents. Rules are scoped per document type:

| profile | meaning | e.g. `as requested by the reviewer` |
|---|---|---|
| `manuscript` | paper body | 🔴 revision residue, flagged |
| `rebuttal` | point-by-point response | ✅ normal, not flagged |
| `cover_letter` | submission letter | 🔴 residue, flagged |
| `review` / `notes` / `unknown` | other | conservative handling |

`writing_audit` accepts a `profile` argument, or auto-detects it from the file path
(rebuttal/cover_letter/manuscript keywords; `reviewer2_comments`, `my_notes`,
`revision_notes` are recognized too).

## What it detects

Based on reviewer-shared AI-writing tell lists (dash overuse, "it's not X but Y", absolutist
definitions, colon-title abuse), the "play to strengths / don't bait reviewers" principle, and
published research (Kobak et al., *Science Advances* 2025, >15M biomedical abstracts;
community word lists delve/tapestry/testament/leverage):

| category | typical issue |
|---|---|
| revision residue | "revised model", "as requested", "we have updated", Chinese 本轮/投稿前/审稿人要求 |
| claim calibration | "we do not claim", Chinese 本文并非要证明, self-deprecation; legitimate limitations are NOT flagged (ICMJE) |
| rhetorical patterns | "不是X而是Y"/"not X but Y", "rather than" overuse, absolutist definitions, rule of three, restatement loops |
| LLM-associated words | delve/tapestry/testament/leverage/harness etc. (density rule — a single occurrence is fine) |
| academic style | we believe/think, vague quantifiers, abstract adverbs; "significantly" only prompts review of statistical context |
| formatting | em-dash density (range en-dashes excluded), colon titles, Unicode math symbols (LaTeX workflow) |

## v0.6 Academic-writing quality guard

Position upgrade: from an "AI-style linter" to a guard that **protects research facts, author style, and writing quality while an agent edits a paper**. Still 100% local regex/statistics — zero network, zero LLM:

| capability | what it detects | example |
|---|---|---|
| **Scholarship Lock** 🔴 | research facts changed during polishing: numbers, percentages, p-values, CIs, units, `\cite`/`\ref`, Figure/Table numbers, DOI | `87.3% → 89.1%` → HIGH: language polishing must not change numbers; restore or explicitly confirm |
| **Defensive saturation (hedge density)** | may/might/could/possibly/potentially ≥5 and ≥300/1k sentences — a caveat on every conclusion | sentence-normalized; legitimate hedging in Discussion is fine (ICMJE) |
| **Hedge stacking** | multiple layers of insurance on one claim | `may potentially suggest` → keep one layer |
| **Overlong + clause-stacked sentences** | EN: >35 words and ≥3 clause markers (which/that/while/because…); ZH: >80 chars and ≥5 commas and ≥3 connectives | split sentences, one claim per sentence |
| **Restatement loops** | same-paragraph sentences with token-cosine ≥0.72 and no new evidence (numbers/citations/entities) in the later ones | delete redundant circles |
| **Author style profile** | `writing_style_profile` learns the author's historical style; drift in sentence-length distribution is flagged | "current median 38 vs author 22" |
| **Strong claim without evidence anchor** | prove/establish/confirm/guarantee with no number/statistic/table/figure citation within ±120 chars | check for an anchor, not a verdict |
| **Consecutive sentence-initial connectives** | ≥3 consecutive sentences starting with Moreover/Furthermore/Additionally in one paragraph | mechanical progression |
| **Unicode math symbols** | ₁₂₃ ²³ α β × − characters in LaTeX prose | use math mode instead |

> Principle (v0.6 design review): never write rules for a specific model (GPT-5.6 style, Opus style — models change, behaviors don't); evidence-based hedging is correct academic expression, this tool is not an "anti-hedge" tool.

## Density thresholds (v0.3.3)

Frequency rules use **per-1000-language-unit** density: English rules are normalized by English
word count, Chinese rules by CJK character count (bilingual files don't dilute each other),
with a **double gate**: `count >= minCount AND count/denominator*1000 >= perK` before flagging.
Examples: "rather than" ≥4 and ≥1.0/1k words; em-dash ≥5 and ≥0.5/1k; LLM words ≥2 and ≥0.4/1k;
Chinese connectives ≥8 and ≥2.0/1k chars. A 500-word abstract and a 12k-word manuscript no longer
share the same threshold.

## Preprocessing (v0.4 segment pipeline, on by default)

Documents are split into typed segments (prose/heading/reference/code/math/table), and each rule
declares which segment types it scans:

- LLM vocabulary, revision residue → `prose`
- colon titles → `heading` only (colons inside body prose don't count)
- references/code/math/table → ignored by default (v0.5.2: an Appendix after References is still scanned)

**Section detection** (Introduction/Methods/Results/Discussion/Conclusion…) powers
`limitations-across-sections`: repeated limitation statements scattered across ≥3 top-level
sections are flagged, while stating limitations once in the Discussion (ICMJE) is not.
(v0.5.2: the section base level adapts to `# Title` + `## Sections` layouts; sub-headings under
a top-level section are never counted as separate sections.)

## Confidence / evidence (v0.3)

Every rule carries `confidence` (high/medium/low) and `evidence` (literature/style-guide/heuristic/project-specific).
Reports show `🔴 HIGH · conf high`, so you know which findings are deterministic rules
(e.g. "revised" residue) and which are probabilistic signals (e.g. LLM word density).

## Tools

| tool | purpose |
|---|---|
| `writing_audit` | scan text/file; args: text/filePath, profile, verbose, projectResidueTerms, original (v0.6 Scholarship Lock: text before polishing — compares research entities), styleProfile (v0.6 author style profile JSON); returns issues sorted by severity+confidence plus full-text stats |
| `writing_rules` | return the writing-discipline cheat sheet (profiles + density rules) |
| `writing_style_profile` | v0.6: learn style metrics (sentence-length median/std, paragraph length, em-dash/hedge/connective density) from the author's previous papers (filePath/learnDir) → JSON for writing_audit's styleProfile |

## Auto-audit (on by default, v0.5 incremental mode)

The plugin listens on `tools/post-execute`: when a **paper-like file** (.md/.tex/.txt whose path
contains manuscript/paper/revision/response/论文/修订/返修…, or inside knowledge-base dirs like
01_manuscript/) is written via `write`/`edit`, it auto-audits (auto profile detection) and
injects the result into the model's next request via `additionalContexts`.

**v0.5 incremental lint**: audit state is persisted per file
(`~/.dsh/plugins/dsh-plugin-writing-guard/state.json`); each write injects only the **delta**
(v0.5.2: fingerprints are based on the matched text itself, so editing other words in the same
paragraph no longer causes false "resolved+added" re-injection):

```text
新增 1 项 / 已解决 4 项 / 仍存在 8 项   (1 new / 4 resolved / 8 remaining)
```

- No change → nothing injected (no repeated nagging)
- Resolved-only → brief confirmation (doesn't consume the per-turn injection budget)
- Only **new** issues are listed with suggestions; the full list is always available via `writing_audit`

Configuration (web profile `cordis.patch.yml`):

```yaml
- id: dsh-plugin-writing-guard
  config:
    autoAuditOnWrite: true          # auto-audit paper writes (default true)
    mode: conservative              # conservative|balanced|strict (overrides minSeverity; default conservative=high)
    autoAuditMinSeverity: high      # high|medium|low (explicit value beats mode)
    maxAutoInjectPerTurn: 2         # max auto-injections per agent turn (only notifications; tracking always runs)
    verboseByDefault: false
    autoBrief: false
    projectResidueTerms: []         # project-internal vocabulary (appended to defaults; flagged as medium)
    stateFile: ''                   # incremental state file (default ~/.dsh/plugins/dsh-plugin-writing-guard/state.json)
```

## FAQ

### Is this an "AI de-flavoring" plugin for DSH?

Sort of — but unlike a traditional Humanizer, Writing Guard detects common AI writing style
*during* the writing/revision process instead of handing the whole text to another model to rewrite.

### Does it support Chinese papers?

Yes. Rules cover both Chinese and English papers: mechanical expressions, templated transitions,
revision residue and defensive writing (Chinese by CJK char count, English by word count).

### Does it support SCI / English academic writing?

Yes. `writing_audit` checks English manuscripts for revision residue, defensive writing,
LLM-overused expressions and common AI-style sentence patterns.

### How is Writing Guard different from academic-humanizer?

academic-humanizer edits existing text toward naturalness; Writing Guard continuously checks
and prevents issues in the DSH paper workflow. They complement each other.

## Tests

```sh
npm test   # builds first, then runs 134 TP/TN/edge-case assertions (zero-dependency runner,
           # incl. isPaperFile/profile detection, fingerprint-stability, Scholarship Lock and style-profile regressions)
```

CI (GitHub Actions) runs build + full tests on every push / PR.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install && pnpm build   # TypeScript -> lib/
# rule engine: src/rules.ts (zero dependencies, pure regex + statistics)
```
