# Visio Component Map

## Intent

This skill does not model all Visio shapes in version 1.

It uses a controlled semantic vocabulary so the analysis side stays stable while the renderer evolves from primitive geometry to richer stencil-aware rendering.

## Why The Vocabulary Is Small

This is deliberate:
- localized Visio stencil names are messy
- early overfitting to master names will make the system fragile
- most flowchart reconstruction work only needs a limited component family

## Future Upgrade Path

The current renderer strategy is:

`scene type -> Visio master when useful, otherwise controlled primitive geometry`

Later we can extend it to:

`scene type -> locale-aware Visio master map -> drop master -> glue connectors`

That future change should not require a schema rewrite if node and edge types remain stable.

## Styling Guidance

Keep defaults restrained:
- white background
- dark neutral strokes
- limited accent colors
- moderate line weight
- clean typography

Use `paper_white` for paper figures and `clean_white` for polished product/process diagrams.

Typography is part of component fidelity. For exact replicas, identify the source's visible font families or at least their roles:

- `paper_serif`: Times/Cambria/Georgia-like academic labels.
- `ui_sans`: Calibri/Arial/Segoe-like product or software labels.
- `math`: Cambria Math/Times-like formulas and operator symbols.
- `cjk_sans` / `cjk_serif`: Chinese labels that need stable glyph metrics.
- `mono`: code-like labels.

Use `font_family_candidates` when the exact font is uncertain or not installed. Use `source_font_family` when the source font is known; if that font is available but the scene resolves to a different family, `scene_audit.py` flags it. Check local availability with:

```powershell
python scripts/font_inventory.py --check "Times New Roman" --check "Calibri" --check "Cambria Math"
```

For exact replicas, prefer explicit `points` and `route` fields over manually nudging node boxes until arrows look right.

For merge/fan connectors, do not draw several arrows directly into the same box edge when the source has a visible shared trunk. Add a `junction_point` at the merge/fan position, route source arrows into that point without arrowheads, then route one final arrow to the destination.

For paper module figures, use `join_connector` for the no-arrow legs into the merge point and `fork_connector` for arrowed fan-out branches. Use `operator_node` when the source has a visible `+`, multiply, or tensor operator; do not replace that symbol with a generic ellipse or plain text.

`operator_node` is a dedicated circle-plus-symbol renderer. Put the operator in `symbol` or `text` on the same node; do not layer a separate `text_block` over an ellipse, because small baseline differences can push `×` or `⊗` outside the circle.

For arrows that enter or leave a dashed module frame, add `boundary_port` nodes on the frame edge. This prevents connector endpoints from drifting to the group box center and makes source-like horizontal stubs possible.

When an arrow should run horizontally from a frame boundary to a target component whose center is at a different height, use a side-ratio endpoint such as `feature_map:left@0.58`. Do not connect boundary ports to default component centers if the source shows a straight horizontal lane.

Use `boundary_arrow` when the visible source arrow starts at the dashed frame edge. Do not add an internal `line_segment` from the previous component to the frame unless that line is actually visible in the source. This prevents false long arrows that appear to originate from a vector strip or internal block.

For classifier outputs, distinguish two grammars:
- If arrows start after `Linear` from a shared internal trunk, use `classifier_head` with explicit `fanout_count`.
- If arrows start from the dashed classifier boundary, set `classifier_head.output_mode: "boundary"` or omit fanout fields, then use `boundary_fanout` on the frame edge.
- If `AvgPool` sits above `Linear`, set `classifier_head.orientation: "vertical"` so the internal arrow is drawn with a visible short shaft and a small arrowhead.

For short internal arrows, use `arrow_size: "small"` on normal edges and `internal_arrow_size: "tiny"` inside vertical classifiers. Visio's default arrowhead is too large for compact paper-module gaps and can look like a standalone triangle.

For waveform input strips and classifier endings, use `wave_signal`, `classifier_head`, and `boundary_fanout` before falling back to raster tiles. These components cover common paper-figure grammar while keeping the result editable.

For input modality brackets and paper-side grouping marks, use `bracket` instead of skinny rectangles. If the bracket has a middle merge arm, set `tick_positions: [0, 0.5, 1]`.

For multimodal pipeline figures, preserve the visible lane grammar:
- Use `image_tile` for source RGB/IR/SAR thumbnails when exact image content matters.
- Use `text_pill` or small `process_box` nodes for `1 or 0` availability flags.
- Use `modality_spine` for the shared vertical gray availability/response bar and encode side ports with `ports`.
- Use explicit horizontal connectors from each modality lane into the projection/fusion module instead of diagonal center-to-center edges.
- Use `lane_arrow` for short local lanes such as cuboid feature blocks into an extractor, `GAP -> GMP`, and feature maps into aggregation. Do not use `route: "straight"` with slightly different y values; it will render as a visibly tilted arrow.

Use `rounded_orthogonal_connector` for source connectors that are visibly axis-aligned but have rounded 90-degree corners. Set `route: "rounded_orthogonal"`, `orthogonalize_points: true`, and `corner_radius_in` or `corner_radius_px`. Do not replace these with `curved_arrow`/`loop_arrow` or `curve_mode: "smooth"`; smooth curves globally bend the lane and can turn an intended right-angle route into a wavy connector.

Use `math_vector` for formula blocks with brackets and stacked entries, especially `q = [q_RGB, q_IR, q_SAR]^T` after a `Quality Head`. Do not rely on Unicode bracket glyphs inside a normal `text_block`; line height and font fallback vary and the bracket/entry alignment often drifts in Visio exports.

Use `math_text` for loss labels such as `Adversarial Loss L_adv`, `Reconstruction Loss L_rec`, and similar inline formulas. Normalize compact spellings (`Ladv`, `Lrec`, `L adv`, `L rec`) to `L_adv` / `L_rec` before rendering. Raw or compact loss notation inside `text_block` is acceptable for rough drafts but is a rebuild issue for exact paper replicas because it visibly differs from math subscript notation.

Use `loop_arrow` or `curved_arrow` for outer GAN/training cycle arrows. A visible loop should be one continuous path with `points`, `end_tangent_point`, and its own arrowhead. For outer update loops, prefer `loop_arrow` with `curve_mode: "smooth"`, `semantic_role: "outer_update_loop"`, and `label_id`/`loop_label_id` bound to the bottom update label. Do not split the loop into several `line_segment` arcs and then draw detached `arrow_connector` heads; that is what makes curves look broken and reverses arrow direction.

Use `tfr_panel` for Real/Generated/Reconstructed TFR panels in GAN-style diagrams. It prevents a common first-pass failure where the panel is split into a background box, floating title labels, grid cells, `Input` text, and a separate internal arrow; that split makes feedback routes cross labels and makes paired grids drift. Use separate child nodes only when the source panel has unusual, independently routed internals.

Use `loss_region` for compact dashed adversarial/evaluation frames where the title and formulas belong to one subsystem. It is the preferred first-pass component for `Forward Reconstruction -> Discriminator Evaluation` plus `L_adv` / `GP` content. Keep the title inside the frame or in a protected header cutout; never let the dashed border run through the title. Use a plain `dashed_region` plus separate `math_text` children only when the source has multiple independently placed items inside the frame.

Use `dashed_region` for dashed annotation rectangles that do not have loss/evaluation semantics. Keep it as a frame, not a generic process node.

Use `dashed_feedback_path` for dashed reconstruction/adversarial/backpropagation paths. Keep these paths orthogonal with explicit points unless the source truly shows a diagonal dashed callout. Do not use `allow_diagonal: true` to hide a wrong dashed route. Do not let these paths draw through the interior of a dashed evaluation frame; route from a boundary point/`boundary_port` and keep the frame clean.

For `loss_region -> target` connections where the target sits directly below/above and horizontally overlaps the loss frame, use short vertical stubs into `target:top@ratio`/`target:bottom@ratio`. Avoid mirrored corner-to-side L-routes; they visually create a second dashed frame and extra arrow around the target.

For GAN/TFR diagrams, generated/reconstructed TFR normally flows into the Discriminator. A main arrow from `Discriminator -> Generated` is usually reversed and should be rebuilt unless the source explicitly labels it as discriminator output.

For bottom loss/backprop systems with several vertical dashed arrows into the same discriminator, use a visible or invisible `merge_bus`/`junction_point` and give related paths a `bundle_id`. This is more stable than drawing several unrelated vertical arrows that crowd the loss text.

Feedback arrows should not terminate at Real/Generated TFR input panels. Panel-to-backprop-bus legs are usually arrowless dashed legs; the arrowheads belong on the discriminator-facing stubs or on the final feedback target.

For Real/Generated TFR panels, keep paired `grid_matrix` nodes on the same y-position with matching size, rows, columns, and cell palette. Keep a clear gap above the `Input` label so arrows, grid, and label do not occupy one strip.

For GAN/TFR first-pass generation, prefer the bundled template and recipe before hand-authoring from scratch:

```powershell
python scripts/image_to_scene.py --image <source.png> --template gan-tfr --output <scene.json>
python scripts/scene_autofix.py <scene.json> --recipe gan-tfr --output <fixed.scene.json>
```

The template expresses the expected topology with `tfr_panel`, `loss_region`, `math_text`, `loop_arrow`, `dashed_feedback_path`, and a bundled backprop bus. The recipe upgrades legacy scenes that used loose panels, empty dashed boxes, raw underscore formulas, reversed discriminator arrows, or detached loop arrowheads.

Run `scripts/scene_audit.py <scene.json> --fail-on-rebuild` after each exact-replica render. A `[REBUILD]` item is not a styling suggestion; it means the local grammar is wrong and coordinate nudging should stop until the subsystem is redrawn.

`scripts/scene_to_visio.py` runs the GAN/TFR autofix once before the rebuild gate and writes `<basename>.autofixed.scene.json` when it changes local grammar. It then runs the rebuild gate automatically for exact-replica and GAN/TFR scenes. Use `--no-autofix` or `--skip-rebuild-gate` only for debugging a known-bad scene; do not use either for delivery.

Use `page_background` when you need to force Visio PNG export to keep the intended canvas. Do not use a blank white `process_box` for this purpose, because it behaves like a real process node and creates false route-intersection warnings.

Use `cuboid_node` for paper blocks that visually show depth, such as modality-related impact factors or tensor-like feature blocks. This keeps the front face editable while preserving the 3D cue with top and side faces. Do not replace these with flat rounded rectangles when the depth cue carries meaning in the source.

Use `trapezoid_node` for directional processing heads and wedge modules, such as `Quality Head`, `Environment Response extractor`, and `Aggregation Quality-aware`. Set `orientation` to the direction of flow. Set `pointed: true` when the source block is triangular or nearly triangular.

When speed requires a small raster tile for a hard wedge/hourglass, record it as a fidelity tradeoff. The audit script flags likely wedge tiles such as `quality_head`, `environment_extractor`, and `aggregation_quality` so they can be replaced with editable primitives later.

Use `polygon_node` as an escape hatch for unusual paper geometry, such as hourglass encoders or asymmetric wedges. Prefer semantic components first; generic polygons should not become the default for ordinary boxes.

`group_container` should not be used as a connector endpoint. It represents a visual frame around a region only. If a figure needs a callout from a framed area, place a small `junction_point` on the desired border and connect to that.

`group_container` titles render as a small top label, not centered text. This keeps dashed module frames from covering internal arrows and blocks. Use `shape: "capsule"` or `shape: "rounded"` when the source has rounded dashed frames.

If the source has no visible module frames, use `audit_region` around logical areas instead of inventing dashed boxes. `audit_region` does not render, but it gives `scene_audit.py` a module boundary for child counts, incoming/outgoing edges, and topology review.

For cross-container flow, split the route:

`source node -> source boundary_anchor -> target boundary_anchor -> target node`

Set `allow_cross_container: true` only on the boundary-anchor bridge. This prevents arrows from visually leaking through dashed module frames.

For dense mini-flow diagrams, use `hv`/`vh` routes or explicit axis-aligned points. A connector must not pass through a non-endpoint node; route it around the node or move it into a bus lane.

For stacked feature maps or repeated blocks, use `stacked_process`. Do not model each offset layer as a separate node unless each layer has separate meaning; otherwise the validator will correctly treat connectors crossing hidden layers as topology defects.

For standalone stubs like a horizontal line from `Contact` toward `AvgPool` that should not visibly point into the `AvgPool` component, use `line_segment` with `from_point` and `to_point`. Use `arrow_connector` only when the source figure clearly has a directional arrowhead or terminates on a shape.

For module interiors such as AM-ResNet, add alignment metadata:
- `align_to_container: ["center_y"]` when a child should sit on the parent frame's midline.
- `align_group` plus `align_axis: "center_y"` when several internal components must share a row.

For exact replicas, set `metadata.fidelity: "exact"` and preserve the source aspect ratio before editing node coordinates. A scene that passes structural validation can still fail as a replica if it uses a tall canvas, random feature-map colors, generic CNN rectangles, or arrows that only satisfy graph semantics instead of the source's visible line grammar.

For exact replicas, prefer pixel-coordinate scenes. Set `page.units: "px"` with the source image dimensions and `target_width_in`; this keeps positions traceable to the source image and avoids drift caused by manual inch estimates.

For large exact replicas, start with a region plan instead of a full-page node list. Use `metadata.region_strategy: "region_first"` or `"tiled_subscenes"`, then add `group_container` and `audit_region` boxes before detailed node authoring. Every meaningful node should have `container_id`; this lets `scene_complexity.py`, `scene_validate.py`, and `scene_audit.py` catch drift, dense regions, uncovered nodes, text-fit problems, and cross-region arrows before Visio rendering.

Keep typography role-based in large scenes. Use a small font scale for frame titles, body labels, small labels, operators, formulas, and edge labels. If validation reports same-type font spread, normalize style tokens before moving nodes around; otherwise visual cleanup becomes fragile and local fixes can make neighboring regions worse.

For AM-ResNet features and similar paper heatmaps, use `feature_map_grid` rather than `feature_map_banded` overlays. Encode row colors and `column_shades` so dark vertical regions blend with the underlying row palette. Do not use opaque black overlays unless the source column is actually solid black.

Visio masters are useful but local. Use `scripts/enumerate_visio_masters.py` to inspect the installed master names on the current machine, then map only the few masters needed for the figure. Do not treat a master dump as a portable schema: stencil names differ by Office version, language, and installed templates.

Do not push chart junk or decorative gradient effects into the schema. The scene should encode structure first and style second.
